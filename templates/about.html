                Darren Rowse has one of the most popular About Us pages on the internet. Why? Because a lot of people go to his website to find out how to actually write an About Us page.

The thing about Darren is that he is his own brand. People love him and become very loyal to the Problogger brand not so much because of its excellent content, but because Darren is a constant voice of guidance and support. His About Us page echoes this personal branding with a story based introduction followed with paragraphs on how you can get the most out of the site and his content.

If I could make one suggestion for Darren it would be to include more of his amazing press. Heâ€™s been mentioned in dozens of newspapers and even been featured on prime time news here in Australia. That is incredible credibility for all the newcomers finding his site.
